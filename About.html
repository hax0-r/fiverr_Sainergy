            <p>Sainergy was formed in 2001 in San Jose, CA as a software staffing organisation providing highly skilled
                SAP personnel to large corporations. In 2007, the company decided to expand from pure staffing to
                implementation of SAP and its related software as a SAP partner for a key customer. The company has now
                evolved into three key areas of operations - software engineer staffing, simple to complex software
                implementations and lastly on-site & off-site IT support for existing and completed projects.</p> <br>
            <br>
            <p>At the helm of Sainergy are <b>Priyanka & Dhruv Gupta</b>, who have over 20 years of experience in this
                industry. Each of Sainergy's practice leads have over 15 years of hands-on SAP experience, whereas the
                average experience of our consultants in IT is 20+ years and 8+ years in SAP. While building our team,
                it has always been our vision to ignite the passion for success and excellence in everyone working for
                Sainergy. </p>
